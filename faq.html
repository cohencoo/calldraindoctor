      var faqs = [
        ['How quickly should I expect drain cleaning service for a clog?', 'Some drain cleaning companies make promises they cannot fulfill, such as service in one hour or less. The timeliness of the sewer cleaning service provided depends on a number of factors. The size of the sewer cleaning company, the area they service, and their in-house infrastructure, are just some factors that determine the response time.<br><br>A reputable drain cleaning company should be able to provide an accurate response time to within a half an hour. If delays occur, advanced notice provided to the client is the industry norm. Most service should be able to be provided in one to two hours. This accounts for travel time as well. You would always verify that you are in the drain company’s service area.'],
        ['What should I expect to pay for sewer and water main cleaning?', 'Often an exact price is only determined once the nature, and the extent of the problem is diagnosed. However, be forewarned that many firms are reluctant to give a price, and have various contingencies in place in order to change the price after it is quoted.<br><br>You should expect to pay what you were quoted with any changes mutually approved. Unless some obvious and unforeseen condition exists, the price should remain intact. If addition equipment is needed, or the reported condition changes, it may be reasonable to expect a change in the quoted price. If you hear the technician saying things such as “I need the big machine”, or “It is further out than what I thought”, it may be one of those times.'],
        ['How do I deal with tree roots in a drain line?', 'If tree roots are present in a drain line, it is imperative to take action prior to having a complete blockage. Once the water stops flowing in a pipe, many products can no longer be used. Copper sulfate and the product Root-X are commonly used to kill roots inside a drain pipe. However, they only work if there is a flow of water.<br><br>Once completely blocked by roots a drain cleaning machine can frequently open the pipe up on a temporary basis. Future cleanings will be needed, and a possible sewer repair or replacement may be inevitable. Once roots are present, it is almost impossible for a sewer cleaning machine to cut them all out, or for the roots to not grow in again.'],
        ['Can I prevent clogged drain lines?', 'There are various ways to help prevent clogged drain lines. They range from common-sense steps like not putting grease, excessive soap, or food down the drain. To placing a strainer on the end of a washing machine drain hose to catch lint and other objects.<br><br>Placing a strainer on bathtub and shower drains is also a good idea. Catching hair and other objects before they go down your drain will prevent the need for frequent drain cleaning.'],
        ['What is water jetting?', 'A drainage clog is surely a problem, but most are relatively simple to fix. You need a home plunger and a little elbow grease. Occasionally, however, these clogs, which may be deep in the line, pose a bigger problem than you think. The line could be completely blocked, which prevents water and waste from escaping down the drain. Before long, all of it will rise back up and seep into the sink, bathtub, or toilet. It will be a complete mess.<br><br>The answer? Hydro-Jetting. Hydro-Jetting is an innovative new method that guarantees a clean drain anywhere in the home. It is a safe, effective alternative to the typical drain cleaning methods using high-pressure blasts of water to clean the interior of the pipe.'],
        ['When should I repair or replace a drain or sewer line?', 'There are obvious times when a drain or sewer line should be repaired or replaced. One instance, of course, is when the line cannot be cleaned. If heavy and extensive root infiltration exists if should be replaced. Extensive root growth is indicative of the failure of the entire line. If a backpitch of the line exists, an extensive section of the run of pipe typically has to be replaced to have the correct pitch.<br><br>Other conditions make the decision to repair or replace a sewer pipe much more difficult. One of the factors is strictly personal. Some people only have to live through one or two clogs to decide to replace the sewer line. Other people will suffer through years of stoppages, and thousands of dollars in drain cleaning bills, before they agree to do repair work.<br> <br> It is fair to say that if a skilled drain technician needs to spend many hours to clear out a stoppage, that means something is structurally wrong with the drain line. In those cases, a video camera inspection can go a long way in determining your next appropriate step.'],
        ['What\'s the difference between a clog in a sewer line versus a storm line?', 'This post will give you a detailed overview of the difference between storm and sewer lines.<br><br>To put it simply,<br><br>Storm lines carry rainwater and groundwater to open bodies of water such as streams, lakes and oceans.<br><br>Sewer, or sanitary, lines carry wastewater from homes and commercial buildings to treatment plants.<br><br>Storm drains and sewer drains are typically installed separately to prevent cross contamination.<br><br>Clogs in sewer lines can be much more hazardous as they can cause backups in wastewater filled with bacteria.'],
        ['What is a sewer line cleanout and where are they usually located?', 'While the city is responsible for the municipal sewer pipes, you are responsible for the health of the pipes on your property that lead to them.<br><br>When cleaning out the sewer lines you are responsible for, we enter through the sewer line cleanout. Sewer line cleanouts are usually 4-inch pipes with a screw cap that has a square knob or indentation.<br><br>They are commonly found coming out of the ground outside your home, or on the side of your home, close to a bathroom.<br><br>If you’re unsure of where yours is, a professional can help you quickly find it using proper skills and tools.'],
        ['Multiple drains in my house are flowing slow. How do I unclog them?', 'When multiple drains in your home are flowing very slowly, not at all, or worst of all, backing up, you most likely have a problem with your MAIN sewer line.'],
        ['What is a MAIN sewer line?', 'The main line is the only pipe that carries wastewater out of your home. All the other pipes leading away from sinks, showers, toilets, etc. tie into the main line.'],
        ['Can sewer line and drain cleaning remove tree roots from pipes?', 'If tree roots are present, they increase your pipes’ risk of damage or collapse. They also increase the risk of clogs, as other food waste and debris can get tangled up in them.<br><br>Not all sewer line and drain cleaning methods can completely remove tree roots. The most effective method for removing tree roots from pipes is hydro jetting.'],
        ['Will the tree roots grow back into the pipes after they’re cleaned out?', 'Yes. Once the tree roots have entered your sewer line, they can only be removed from the inside. And, unfortunately, they will continue to grow back and infiltrate your sewer system. The only way to permanently resolve this problem is to have your sewer lined or replaced with pipes made of stronger materials.'],
        ['Why do I need a professional for sewer line and drain cleaning?', 'Often times, clearing a clogged drain is more complex that it seems. Homeowners unfamiliar with how to properly use a drain snake, or auger, may end up causing more damage. The most common form of damage is cracked or broken pipes as a result of too much pressure or force.<br><br>Similarly, attempting to unclog a drain with a drain cleaner, or harsh chemical, can end up causing more harm than good. Over time, these chemicals can cause erosion and leaks. There are even some types of pipes that should NEVER come in contact with drain cleaners.'],
