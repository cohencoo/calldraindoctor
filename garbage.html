        Garbage Disposal Problems? At Drain Doctor LLC, we’re always happy to step in when home garbage disposal units are out of order. Give us a call for pricing and availability or keep reading below for some more information and some pictures.
        It’s not uncommon for us to respond to a call about a “broken” disposer, only to discover that the unit is simply jammed or needs to be reset. And those are actually easy fixes that most homeowners are capable of performing on their own.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Resetting a Garbage Disposal 
        </h2>
        <br><br>
        If you turn on your garbage disposal and nothing happens (that is, you don’t hear any sounds at all), it is possible that the mechanism needs to be reset. Your unit should have a small button on the bottom, and resetting the system is simply a matter of pressing that button. If your kitchen sink looks anything like ours, clearing out the cabinet under the sink and locating the switch (a flashlight helps) is truly the most difficult part of the process!
        <br><br>
        Once you hit the button, the disposer should immediately start working again. If it doesn’t, then it might be jammed.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Unjamming a Garbage Disposal</h2>
        <br><br>
        If you turn on your garbage disposal and hear a buzzing sound, then it’s possible that the unit is jammed. In other words, something (be it a large, hard food scrap or a foreign object) is caught in the blades and preventing them from moving. First, unplug the disposal from the wall outlet under the sink.
        <br><br>
        If scooping at the inside of the drain with your fingers (or a pair of needle-nosed pliers) doesn’t reveal the obstruction, you’ll need to take an indirect approach. On the bottom of your garbage disposal unit, there should be a small Allen wrench socket. Place an appropriately sized Allen wrench into this socket and vigorously work the wrench back and forth for a few seconds. Often times, this motion is enough to dislodge a jam, and the unit will roar back to life the next time you hit the power switch.
        <br><br>
        Now, if the aforementioned fixes don’t work, then it probably IS time to call a plumber. A professional technician will be able to diagnose the problem and advise you on the solution, whether it’s to have the system repaired or replaced completely. 
        Make sure you get one that will fit in your space and is comfortable. If you have a small bathroom, you may consider getting a round bowl instead of an elongated bowl. New toilets on the market today are available in a variety of sizes, some are compact, while others are tall and narrow. Also, check the plumbing “rough-in” dimensions (the measurements where the sewer and water pipes are on the floor and wall). The industry-standard rough-in dimension for the toilet drain is 12” off the back wall to the center. Measure off of the back wall to the place where the bolts are around the base of your existing toilet to be sure.
