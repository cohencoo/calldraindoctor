        Having a dripping or leaking faucet is one of the more common plumbing issues homeowners experience. The good news is that these issues can be repaired most of the time by rebuilding the faucet. At Legacy, we are skilled in faucet repair and carry enough parts on our trucks to resolve over 80% of these issues during a single visit. We also help with diagnosis and can order parts for specialty and more rare faucets. Often, replacing a sink faucet is cheaper than the labor to repair and fix with parts. It may also be in your best interest to upgrade to the latest faucet style and trends. Legacy can install any new faucet provided by a homeowner, we recommend having it on hand before scheduling. We also offer several standard faucet options on our trucks for your convenience. Give us a call for a quote, our team can even apply the cost of the repair towards a faucet replacement.

          Kitchen and Bathroom Sink Faucet Replacement 
        </h2>
        <br><br>
        The most popular type of kitchen faucet in DFW is the single-handle faucet. When these faucets start to drip, they typically need a new cartridge. If the faucet is leaking from another spot other than the spout, then there are likely other o-rings or seals that would need to be replaced to resolve the issue (provided the faucet isn’t too badly corroded).
        <br><br>
        Bathroom faucets traditionally have two-handles. While newer faucets use two separate ceramic-disc cartridges for the hot and cold. Some Delta faucets use rubber cup seals to function. If the faucet is dripping from the spout or leaking around the handles during use, it most likely can be resolved by replacing the cartridges.
        <br><br>
        Drain Doctor LLC technicians stock parts to troubleshoot and repair common faucet leaks and problems. If we do not have the parts on hand, we can diagnose the issue and provide a free quote on repairs or replacement. Then we can return and install the parts on a secondary visit when they arrive.
        <br><br>   
        <h2>Kitchen and Bathroom Sink Faucet Installation </h2>
        <br><br>  
        There are many different styles of kitchen faucets and kitchen sink basins. Make sure you have a faucet that is compatible with the number of holes that are drilled in the countertop/sink basin.
        <br><br>  
        Whether you have an undermount sink or self-rimming kitchen sink basin often factors into the difficulty of installation. Undermount sinks and farmhouse-style sinks frequently have a much tighter space underneath the sink between the basin and the back of the cabinet. If the old faucet was slowly leaking for some time, then the faucet could very well be rusted into place. Some faucets can be very difficult to remove. For Drain Doctor LLC, it doesn’t matter if the access is especially tight or if the older faucet puts up a fight. We’ve got the tools and techniques to do the job efficiently without damaging your sink.

        <br><br>  
        In addition to replacing faucets, we also replace sink basins if they are of the self-rimming type. We do not offer the replacement or installation of under-mount sinks at this time.
        <br><br>  
        While kitchen faucets are usually only sold with the faucet itself and maybe a soap dispenser, bathroom faucets will typically come with a popup assembly and stopper that is installed as part of the drain. Our flat-rate for installing a bathroom vanity faucet includes this drain work.
        <br><br>  
        Some bathroom faucets are single-piece or center set. Some faucets are three-piece or widespread. The widespread faucets are usually the trickiest because everything has to stay lined up exactly right as it is tightened in order to look good.

        <h2>
          Show/Tub Valve Repair
        </h2>
        <br><br>  
        You can generally break down the parts of a tub/shower faucet into two categories: trim parts and valve body. The “trim” parts are the decorative parts of the shower valve that you can see: the showerhead, the tub spout, the handle, etc. As these pieces are decorative, they mostly fail in only a cosmetic way by corroding over time. 
        <br><br>  
        If the valve doesn’t turn on, leaks, or has issues getting hot or cold water, then the issue is probably with the valve body or the cartridge inside it. A worn-out cartridge is the most common problem for shower/tub faucets. Fortunately, the cartridge can usually be accessed in a straight-forward way by removing the trim.
        <br><br>  
        <h2>
          Show/Tub Valve Replacement
        </h2>
        <br><br>  
        The valve body is connected directly to the pipes in the wall. If it has to be replaced, you must either access it by cutting a hole in the wall on the other side or through the tile/enclosure in front. The valve must be plumbed at just the right height and depth in order to accommodate the tile or shower surround.
        <br><br>  
        Replacing a tub valve for a Roman tub or garden tub follows a similar process. Access has to be made underneath the tub. Once the valve body is exposed, the old one can be cut out and the new one soldered to the pipes coming out of the floor. Once the valve body is installed just right, the trim can be reinstalled.
        <br><br>  
        <h2>
          Outdoor Faucet Replacement
        </h2>
        <br><br>  
        The most common outdoor faucet in Allen County is the frost-proof faucet. If you have one, then it is very important to make sure it is properly winterized. 
        <br><br>  
        If the faucet is spraying or dripping water only when in use, chances are it can be repaired by replacing the vacuum breaker or tightening the packing nut. If, however, the faucet is dripping constantly even when turned off, then it is probably an issue with the valve seat/valve seal. Although this can sometimes be repaired, we generally recommend replacing the entire faucet.
        <br><br>  
        Most of the time, this can be done from the outside, but sometimes our team needs access inside the wall. 
        <br><br>  
        When it comes to plumbing fixtures, faucet replacement, or simple faucet repairs, Drain Doctor LLC  gets the job done right every time. Don’t let your bathroom sink go without a bathroom faucet, don’t ignore the annoying dripping sound of a poor plumbing installation; we can help!
