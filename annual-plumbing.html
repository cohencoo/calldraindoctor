            <b>OUR ANNUAL INSPECTION SERVICE INCLUDES:A VIDEO PIPE INSPECTION OF YOUR SEWER OR SEPTIC LINE</b>
            <br><br>
            Through our informal polling, we’ve discovered that no homeowner wants a basement full of sewage. All drain
            lines have the potential to develop problems. If your drain lines are original to your home, it is not
            unusual to discover issues such as roots, breaks, dips, and clogs. These should be addressed and monitored
            so that they do not become something worse. Even new drain lines can have problems. Although modern PVC is a
            great piping material, damaging accidents can still happen. Has your child ever flushed a toy down a toilet,
            or did a house guest send something down a drain they shouldn’t have? Problems like these cause backups even
            in perfectly installed plumbing drains. A video pipe inspection is a great way to keep a backup from
            sneaking up on you.

            <b>A LEAK TEST ON YOUR WATERLINE</b>
            <br><br>

            Is your high water bill from your teenager taking long showers, or is it something more serious? A leaking
            water line can do more damage than just an expensive water bill. It is not unusual for leaking water lines
            to create soggy yards, flooded basements, and mold problems on your property. Finding leaks early on
            prevents a small problem from becoming a serious one.
            <br><br>

            <b>EXERCISING OF ALL ACCESSIBLE MAIN VALVES</b>
            <br><br>

            Have you ever considered what would happen if your water heater or washing machine suddenly begins to leak?
            What would you do if a water pipe bursts in a wall? The first step in any plumbing disaster is to turn off
            the water. But where is the shut-off valve you need? Does it even work? Plumbing valves often corrode and
            become inoperable. Exercising these valves on an annual basis makes sure they work when they’re needed.

                Even if you have had your sewer line, septic system, or water line replaced, an annual inspection
                service can be beneficial. Like all quality plumbers, we stand behind our work and guarantee a high
                level of craftsmanship. Even so, accidents can happen to anyone at any time. The potential for home
                maintenance accidents is why most people have insurance. But having insurance doesn’t mean you look
                forward to dealing with the inconvenience, expense, damage, and disruption of a plumbing problem. Our
                annual inspection service catches issues early on before they become serious.

                If any potential problems are found during your inspection, we provide several options for repair. Just
                because something will break in the future does not necessarily mean it needs to be fixed immediately.
                Whether you choose an immediate fix or not, we do provide a full report of our findings with every
                inspection. This information allows us to chart the severity of problems from year to year. Using these
                reports can help you make an informed decision about when to fix any of your home’s plumbing issues.
