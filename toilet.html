        Does your toilet clog all the time? Does it run constantly or randomly kick on and off or “ghost flush”? Does it leak or make weird noises?
        <br><br>
        There is a lot that can go wrong with toilets. The problems can range from annoying to downright dangerous. Sometimes, the best option is to unclog and repair the toilet. While a new toilet installation can be more economical and deliver other benefits (conserve water, bidet features, easy to clean). At Drain Doctor LLC, we can help homeowners troubleshoot problems and provide pros and cons of repair vs replace.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Toilet Installation </h2>
        <br><br>
        There are many different styles of toilets on the market today – several offer innovative flushing features while others are different sizes for comfort. If you’d like to shop around and pick your dream toilet online or in a store, then we’d be glad to install that for you. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
        <br><br>
        Make sure you get one that will fit in your space and is comfortable. If you have a small bathroom, you may consider getting a round bowl instead of an elongated bowl. New toilets on the market today are available in a variety of sizes, some are compact, while others are tall and narrow. Also, check the plumbing “rough-in” dimensions (the measurements where the sewer and water pipes are on the floor and wall). The industry-standard rough-in dimension for the toilet drain is 12” off the back wall to the center. Measure off of the back wall to the place where the bolts are around the base of your existing toilet to be sure.
        <br><br>
        Traditionally, toilets are two-piece: a tank mounted on a bowl which is the standard, builder-grade, economical option. Installing one-piece, wall-mounted, bidet, and high-end toilets can be different. Keep in mind that this may add to the overall cost of installation depending on the design.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Toilet Repair 
        </h2>
        <br><br>
        Sometimes all a toilet needs is a new flapper. Sometimes, it needs a whole rebuild. Whatever the case, we have all of the parts and tools on hand to take care of the issue quickly.
        <br><br>
        On the surface, some toilet repairs may seem simple, but did you know that callbacks on toilet repairs are common for plumbing companies? Not getting a toilet fixed right the first time isn’t good for business, and it is super-inconvenient for customers. It all comes down to having the right parts and the understanding of everything that has to work together to make a good flush. You can’t just be a parts-changer!
        <br><br>
        <h2>
          Fill Valve
        </h2>
        <br><br>
        The fill valve controls the flow of water into the toilet. A float senses when the water level inside the toilet drops and the valve turns on to fill the toilet tank back up with water after a flush. A broken fill valve may result in a slow fill, constant running, or weird noises when the tank is flushed.
        <br><br>
        <h2>
          Flapper
        </h2>
        <br><br>
        The flapper or flush disk is the seal that holds the tank water in the tank. It is directly linked to the toilet handle. When the handle is pressed, the flapper raises and lets the water down into the bowl, creating the flush. When the flapper needs replaced, it can result in a toilet that runs constantly or at odd times. It can also weaken a toilet’s flush.
        <br><br>
        <h2>
          Tank Seals
        </h2>
        <br><br>
        The tank seals are what keep the tank mounted to the base in a way that it doesn’t leak. There are usually bolt washers and a tank-to-bowl gasket that accomplish this. If the tank-to-bowl gasket goes bad, the toilet will leak onto the floor every time the toilet is flushed. If the toilet tank bolts washers are bad, then the toilet will constantly drip water down onto the floor below.
        <br><br>
        <h2>
          Base Seal
        </h2>
        <br><br>
        A wax ring is the traditional method of sealing the base of the toilet to the flange that comes up through the floor. If the toilet is mounted incorrectly and rocks or wobbles at the base, then that compromises the wax ring seal and creates an opportunity for the toilet to leak every time it’s flushed or if the system backs up.
