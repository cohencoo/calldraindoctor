WHAT TO DO WHILE WAITING FOR EMERGENCY SEWER AND DRAIN ASSISTANCE TO ARRIVE
        </h2>
        <br><br>
Without question, a sewer and drain emergency can cause any homeowner to experience full-on panic – and for good reason.
        <br><br>
Waiting a matter of minutes to call an emergency drain technician can cost you thousands of dollars in damage. That’s why it’s vital to call at the first sign of an issue.
        <br><br>
Even if you’re quick to call us for 24-hour emergency sewer and drain service, there are still time-sensitive procedures you should do to minimize leakage, flooding and overall damage.
        <br><br>
You can prevent a bigger, more expensive mess by taking the following actions while you wait for us to arrive:
        <br><br>
        <b>Shut Off Water Supply:</b>
Locate your main water valve and turn it off immediately. Turning off your water will cut the supply to your home or business and minimize water damage. If you don’t know where your main water valve is, ask us on the phone where to look and we will do our best to help you locate it before we arrive.        <br><br>
        <b>Drain the Lines:</b>
If the weather is warm enough outside where your hose and spigots are still available, turn them all on to purge any residual liquid left in your water lines.
          <br><br>
        <b>Remove Standing Water:</b>
 Get on top of cleaning standing water right away. If you can, turn on fans, open doors and windows and remove/dry all water to prevent as much floor and wall damage as you can. In addition to reducing property damage, standing water must be cleaned up to prevent mold build up.
          <br><br>
        <b>Clear Furniture & Other Belongings that are around the problem area:</b>
Move all furniture away from standing water and/or the problem area. This will help you minimize damage to your belongings and give the plumber plenty of room to work when he or she arrives.
          <br><br>
        <b>Check the Electric Appliances:</b>
        To prevent a fire and an explosive situation, check to make sure water is not coming in contact with any electric appliance, such as the fuse box and water heater. Turn all electric appliances off if you feel water is or will come in contact with them.
        <br><br>
        <b>Take Notes & Photos:</b>
        For insurance claim purposes, document as much as you can so you have evidence and information on your emergency situation for your insurance provider.
        <br><br>
        <b>Don’t try to fix the issue:</b>
        Plumbing issues are complex in nature – especially emergency situations. Trying to fix some or most of the issue yourself can mean even more damage and money.
        <br><br>
        A compromised job can mean:
        <ul style="margin-left: 3rem;">
          <li>Your insurance provider won’t cover the emergency situation</li>
          <li>Your furniture and belongings get damaged beyond repair</li>
          <li>The structural integrity of your home or business is compromised</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>

        <h2>EXPERIENCING AN EMERGENCY SEWER AND DRAIN BACKUP </h2>
        As sewer and drain experts, we can quickly remedy a sewer backup. 
        <br><br>
        After a quick and necessary main sewer line inspection, where we send a camera through your sewer pipe to determine the problem, we will get to work on the best solution for your emergency situation.

        <br><br>
        Once the emergency is under control, we may advise you need a sewer line cleaning, repair or replacement to completely remedy the situation. Call <a class="link" href="tel:260-557-3616" target="_system">260-557-3616</a>
